# Real-Time-Hand-Gesture-Game-Controller
Developed a hand-gesture controller using OpenCV and MediaPipe to simulate keyboard arrow keys, allowing real-time control of player movements in games like Subway Surfers. Features include index finger tracking, movement detection with dead zones, visual overlays, and frame capture.

What This Script Enables You To Do:
-Move your hand left, right, up, or down in front of the webcam to trigger arrow key presses.
-Visualize hand position on-screen with colored zones and lines.
-Capture images of the video feed on demand.
